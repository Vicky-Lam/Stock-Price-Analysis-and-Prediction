# Stock-Price-Analysis-and-Prediction

Nay hoh, 

Thank you for showing your interest in this repo.

I got inspired by the course I am doing on Educative - [Predictive Data Analysis in Python](https://www.educative.io/courses/predictive-data-analysis-with-python), so with the guidance provided by the course, I developed my code to predict stock prices of the companies of my interest.

Data source: [Yahoo Finance](https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/)

Companies: KAOOY: Kao Corporation, UL: Uilever, PG: Procter & Gamble

Thanks again for reading.

Best,

Vicky
